# Contribution 

To **contribute** to the project you should follow these quick rules :

## Contribution rules :

### Notation :

For more readability please choose to write your code following one of those two types of notation :

- **camelCase** notation
- **snake_case** notation
- **singular** form

> As the **plural form** might be confusing some times *(and because it's frustrating to get an error because of missing 's')*, please use the **singular** form for your **file**, **classes**, **methods**, **functions** and **variable** name. You can use the **plural** form in case you think the **readability** would take benefit from it.

### File :

For more readability and to reduce the amount of time spent to look for a file, please follow these rules :

- File name :
    - Your **file name** should not be *too long* and must be as **explicit** as possible.
    
    > After reading your file name, I should have a clear idea of what I can find in it.

- File content :
    - Each file must contain a **specific content** to answer a certain purpose.

    > Do not put some **character** stuff in a file that manages **player**'s resources.

### Method and Function :

For more readability it's highly recommended to use **class methods** as much as possible *(except in the case that it would reduce the readability)*.

### Class :

Please choose your **class name** wisely.

The **command** classes name should always begin with the `Cmd_` prefix.

### Comment :

Do not hesitate to **comment** your code !

## Pull request :

Do not forget to `PULL` before every `PULL REQUEST`.

Do not `PUSH` non-tested code.

Moreover, add a **detailed** explanation note to every `COMMIT` you make to allow us know what you've done and **why**.

Also join the `expected OUTPUT` and `behaviour` to allow us test your code easily.
